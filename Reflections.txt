Today has been something that I have never experienced before. It was alot of information to take in. I'm not going to lie, it was pretty overwhelming. With having no experience in coding, all of this was and is very new to me. I understand that its all new info so it will take a little bit to sink in and I am going to really push myself to work outside of class so I can try to get a better understanding as we go on. I know that while the class progresses that it is only going to get harder but the more information I can learn quickly, the better off I will be in the long run.

I was happy with all of the new infor that I was able to take in and I realize that it isn't going to just come to me overnight. I am ready to work my ass off to achieve my goals. I know that this class is going to push me harder than any other schooling because this is a brand new subject. I am up for the challenge and ready to learn how to code.

Thankfully, the teachers and even a few of the students have been very helpful on guiding me in the right direction. Like I said before, it can be a little overwhelming to take all of this new info in, but I am excited to start a new adventure.
